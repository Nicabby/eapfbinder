  // Leadership Competency
  'build-feedback': "Think back to a time when you received helpful feedback. What made it work? How did it impact you?",
  'practice-feedback': "When you've given feedback in the past, what was your approach, and how did the other person respond?",
  'strengthen-feedback': "Was there a time when your feedback didn't land the way you intended? What did you learn from that experience?",
  
  'build-independence': "Think back to your adolescence. Can you remember a moment when you were trusted to decide on your own? How did that experience shape your confidence?",
  'practice-independence': "In your facilitation style, when are you most likely to over-control or over-direct? What's one moment in a session where you could build in more autonomy?",
  'strengthen-independence': "Identify a recent moment when you may have interrupted someone's process too soon. What signs can you look for in the future to help you wait longer, giving someone space to problem-solve before you step in?",
  
  'build-decision-making': "Think about a time when you had to adjust your plans in the moment — in school, work, or a group setting. What signals told you that a change was needed? How did you respond? Looking back, what would you keep the same, and what might you do differently next time?",
  'practice-decision-making': "Think back to a time you had to make a quick decision under pressure. What influenced your choice? Did you act from instinct, habit, fear, or strategy? What would you do differently now with the tools you've gained in this module?",
  'strengthen-decision-making': "Think of a recent moment when something unexpected happened—a shift in energy, a change in schedule, or an unplanned challenge. How quickly were you able to adapt your plan? How could you improve on this?",

  // Communication Competency
  'build-lead-by-example': "Think of a person in your life who leads by example. What values or behaviours do they embody that inspire you?",
  'practice-lead-by-example': "Reflect on a recent experience where your words and actions either aligned well or didn't. What was the outcome? What would you do differently next time to demonstrate consistent messaging?",
  'strengthen-lead-by-example': "Reflect on a challenging facilitation moment you've experienced or anticipate. How can you apply authenticity and clarity to navigate it effectively? What personal strengths can you leverage, and what support might you need?",
  
  'build-nonverbal-awareness': "Think about a time when you noticed someone's body language telling a different story than their words. What did you observe, and how did it affect your understanding of the situation?",
  'practice-nonverbal-awareness': "Think about a recent conversation you had. How did verbal, non-verbal, or written communication affect the way participants responded? Which type of communication do you feel most confident using, and which one do you want to improve?",
  'strengthen-nonverbal-awareness': "Think about a recent experience where communication felt challenging. How did you respond? What strategies did you use to stay authentic and clear? What might you do differently next time to strengthen your communication?",
  
  'build-family-partnership': "Think about communication strategies you've used with others. What strategies did you use or wish you had used? How did your approach affect the relationship? Reflect on how setting clear expectations, using positive framing, and being proactive in updates could improve your future interactions.",
  'practice-family-partnership': "How would you use active listening to understand their concerns better? What strategies would you use to build trust and encourage collaboration? Reflect on what might be challenging and how you can prepare for those moments.",
  'strengthen-family-partnership': "Think about a challenging conversation. How did or would you maintain clarity while showing empathy? What strategies helped or could help you build trust in difficult moments?",

  // Effective Listening Competency  
  'build-listening-strategies': "Think back to a time when someone listened to you so well that you felt understood, even without many words exchanged. What did they do that made you feel safe to open up? How might you bring that same quality of listening into your own facilitation?",
  'practice-listening-strategies': "Think about a time when someone seemed guarded or shut down while talking to you. What did you do in that moment? Looking back, how might a pause, a gentle reflection, or simply sitting in the silence have changed things?",
  'strengthen-listening-strategies': "Reflect on how these small shifts could help keep conversations open, even when they get hard.",
  
  'build-open-ended-questions': "Think back to a time when you were having a conversation that mattered. How did the other person make you feel like they were listening? Did they make you feel safe? valued? understood?",

  // Relationship Building Competency
  'build-group-dynamics': "Think of a time you felt one or more of these dynamics. What did the leader do that shaped that experience? What could you take from that experience and use in your own facilitation?",
  'practice-group-dynamics': "Think back to a time when a group you were a part of felt off—maybe there was tension, disengagement, or imbalance. How did the group leader or facilitator respond? How would you have handled that moment now, using the tools from this lesson?",
  'strengthen-group-dynamics': "What group behaviors tend to trigger a strong reaction in you—and how might you stay grounded when they show up? What helps you stay calm and flexible when things don't go according to plan? What's one part of a session where you tend to feel reactive, and how could you shift into a more responsive mode?",
  
  'build-trust': "Think back to a time when someone earned your trust—or when trust was broken. What did they do (or not do) that shaped how safe you felt with them? How did their consistency, communication, or respect affect your willingness to open up? What small choices can you make as a facilitator to build that kind of trust with your group?",
  'practice-trust': "Take a moment to reflect: What small rituals or routines make a space feel safe for you? How might you bring those elements into your session flow?",
  'strengthen-trust': "Are there moments in your current facilitation where you tend to skip over emotional safety—or assume it's already there?",

  // Self-Reflection Competency
  'build-self-reflection': "Think of a time you misread someone's behavior—maybe in a session, a classroom, or your personal life. What did you assume? What else could have been true in that moment?",
  'practice-self-reflection': "When facilitating, what specific strategies can you implement to create a moment of pause instead of reacting impulsively?",
  'strengthen-self-reflection': "How do you currently check in with yourself after sessions? What would make it easier?",

  // Equity & Inclusion Competency
  'build-bias-awareness': "Think of a time when you made a snap judgment about someone—maybe based on how they looked, how they spoke, or even their body language. What was your assumption? Did it turn out to be true? How might that same assumption show up silently in your role as a facilitator?",
  'practice-bias-awareness': "Take a moment to reflect: When I feel rushed or uncomfortable, do I tend to favor certain participants or personalities? What types of behavior do I find easier to affirm—or quicker to correct?",
  'strengthen-bias-awareness': "Instead of trying to \"fix\" bias all at once, ask: What am I regularly doing to create space for the margins? How often do I pause and reflect on who I'm unintentionally centering—or excluding?",
  
  'build-inclusion-scanning': "Think back to a time when you were in a group and felt left out—not because anyone said something hurtful, but because no one noticed you were quiet, hesitant, or unsure. What made you feel that way? Did anyone check in? What would you have needed to feel included?",
  'practice-inclusion-scanning': "Think back to a time when you were part of a group—maybe in school, at work, or in a social setting. Did you feel like your presence made a difference? Was your voice heard—or overlooked? What made you feel welcome… or invisible?",
  'strengthen-inclusion-scanning': "Think about a time when you felt like you truly belonged—not just that you were allowed to be there, but that your presence was valued. What made that space feel safe or welcoming? Did someone do something specific to help you feel seen? Were there structures or choices that allowed you to show up in your own way?"
