As a facilitator, your leadership shapes how safe, engaged, and empowered participants feel in your group.\n\nThis module will help you strengthen three key leadership skills:\n\n• Providing Feedback that encourages growth instead of correction alone.\n• Fostering Independence by giving participants space to make choices, practice autonomy, and discover their own strengths.\n• Decision Making so you can calmly adjust when plans shift, energy changes, or challenges arise.\n\nStrong leadership is both structured and soft. It means creating consistency and boundaries while also allowing flexibility and care. Through this module, you will practice leading in real time—whether it's guiding discussions, supporting youth through challenges, or stepping back to let them take the lead.\n\nThe goal is not perfection, but presence: showing up with clarity, courage, and compassion so participants feel seen, supported, and inspired to rise.",
